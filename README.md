# Projects in Scala

This is another language that I have taken a personal interest in and plan to add to the list of languages I know. 
It is a language I am learning on my own time along with C. 

This interest came from my love of Java and the idea of better understanding functional programming. 
With Scala being a newer language, I also hope to stay on the cutting edge of programming and find the most efficient ways I can complete the tasks required of me.
